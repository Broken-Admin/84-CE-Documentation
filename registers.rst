Registers and Indirection
********************************

If you've ever programmed in a different language, you've used something called variables to store your data temporarily. In assembly, we use registers.

There are many registers you can use in assembly. The ones we will be covering today are: A, B, C, D, E, F, H, and L, which can be paired together to form AF, BC, DE, and HL. As you probably have guessed, when a register is paired with another it can hold more information.

Recall from the last tutorial bits and bytes? H is a 1 byte register, or 8 bits, while HL is a 2 byte register, or 16 bits.
